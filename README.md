# MIC-AI-ML-Department-Assignment
Overview
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset using two popular machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. The assignment includes a comparison of both model accuracies, with results visualized in a bar chart.

Files Included
imdb_classifier.py: Python code for training and evaluating both classifiers and plotting the accuracy comparison.

IMDB Dataset.csv: Dataset of IMDB movie reviews with sentiment labels.

README.md: Project description, instructions, results, and analysis.

model_accuracy_comparison.png: Bar chart image comparing model accuracies. Generated by the script.

Data Preprocessing:
--Loaded the IMDB dataset using pandas.

--Removed missing values (if any).

--Converted sentiment labels to numeric (positive = 1, negative = 0).

--Used CountVectorizer (Bag of Words) to transform review text into numeric features suitable for model training and prediction.

Models Compared:
--Logistic Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression)

--Multinomial Naive Bayes (sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB)

Training & Evaluation:
--Split the data into train and test sets (80% training, 20% testing).

--Trained both models on training data.

--Evaluated accuracy for both models on the test data.

Results:
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	88.76%
Multinomial Naive Bayes	84.87%
Visual Comparison
The following bar chart shows the accuracy of both models:

Regression achieved 88.76% accuracy, outperforming Naive Bayes, which achieved 84.87% accuracy on this IMDB review sentiment classification task.

How to Run the Project:
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Place IMDB Dataset.csv and imdb_classifier.py in the same folder.

Run the script:

python imdb_classifier.py
The output will show sample predictions, both model accuracies (as percentages), and display a comparison graph (model_accuracy_comparison.png)<img width="593" height="399" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b583cac8-61db-4e29-9ebf-73d6ba3734ec" />
